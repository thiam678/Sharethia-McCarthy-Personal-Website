  <h2><u><i> Vision staement</h2></u></i>
  <p style="line-height:200%"><font size="+1"> In the future, I aspire to be financially stable where I can give back to my family and country.
  Being financially stable means I am well settled in a permanent job in the computing field and having 
  my own assets such as a car and a house. Moreover, using that money to invest in businesses for even a 
  higher income where I can give to family and country as stated above. However, if this vision is not fulfilled 
  I would like to become something that I like very much and that is a footballer where I either play for my 
  country or one of my favorite football clubs which is Liverpool and Barcelona. Iâ€™m already good at the sport
  and the fact that I love it so much it would be great to have a career in that sector. Growing up I always 
  said that I wanted to do something that I love or getting a career in my field of study and that is Football
  and computing respectively. So with my high hopes that I never lost I know, I will fulfill one of these visions.</p></br></font>
 
  <h2><u><i> Mission Statement </h2></u></i>
  <p style="line-height:200%"><font size="+1">Currently, I try to stay focused in school and be very hardworking and determined. I also plan on doing 
  internships to get as much experience in computing jobs which would be great for my resume in the future. Furthermore,
  as it relates to football, I'm yet to find an opportunity that would showcase my potential so that the people of
  the country could see what I'm capable of. And with that training and experience, it is possible that I could end up 
  playing for one of my favorite clubs. Hence, to accomplished all of this, I plan to stay dedicated, determined,
  hardworking and, focused and also having the faith, hope, and support from loved ones to get the result of these actions.</p></br>
